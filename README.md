Leveraging Machine Learning Techniques for Accurate Weather Prediction

Weather forecasting has become increasingly vital in recent times, as it plays a pivotal role in saving time, resources, and even lives. While India boasts numerous weather stations, they are primarily concentrated in densely populated areas like cities and suburbs, leaving remote regions with less precise forecasts. This can pose challenges, especially for professionals like farmers who heavily rely on weather predictions for their daily activities.

In this study, we employ a diverse set of machine learning techniques, encompassing both classification and regression methods, to predict weather patterns. We analyze various meteorological features, including temperature, apparent temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind bearing, visibility, and cloud cover. Our ensemble of machine learning methods comprises Random Forest, Ridge,  Through extensive experimentation and analysis, we present our findings and insights derived from these methodologies.
